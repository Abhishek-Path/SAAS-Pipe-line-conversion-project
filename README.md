Business Problem – Sales Pipeline Conversion in a SaaS Startup
This assignment is based on a case study on TechnoServe, a fictitious Tech SaaS (software as a service) startup that specialises in offering various software services to small and medium enterprise customers. The products offered by the company are geared towards increasing productivity for its customers. Its software solutions are customised based on the customers’ needs and the amount they are willing to spend on a product.

 

As TechnoServe is a SaaS provider, its revenue is highly dependent on the number of clients. However, the company faces a pertinent problem that is prevalent in the IT industry today: declining conversions across its sales funnel. This means the company is failing to convert its potential customers into clients.

 Project Objective
To understand the problem, suggest hypotheses for the low conversions faced by TechnoServe and analyse the data set provided to arrive at possible solutions to increase the conversions.
